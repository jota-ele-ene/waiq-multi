In a world driven by constant technological evolution, we find ourselves at the epicentre of a revolution that is redefining the way we interact with our environment and with each other. In this context, {{< waiq >}} technologies, namely **Web3, Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Sciences**, are emerging as three fields that have the potential to revolutionise the world of computing and information technology. These technologies are not isolated fields, but rather combine and reinforce each other in unexpected ways, giving rise to opportunities for innovation and transformation far greater than those brought about by the convergence of the Internet, mobility or the cloud. Some even predict that in the next seven years there will be an impact 70 times greater than that of the Industrial Revolution in its first 70 years. 

In this context, {{< waiq >}} technologies will help solve complex problems that are currently unsolvable, but they will also give rise to new ones, and, as we are already seeing today with the mass adoption of artificial intelligence, society will embark on a path that is not without risks. Uncertainty is inevitable, but it is our responsibility to manage this transition in a socially responsible manner, paying attention not only to technology and its potential economic impact, but also to the influence of regulation, intellectual property challenges and ethical and human dimensions on its development and adoption. Only then will we be in a position to sufficiently anticipate potential threats, avoid uncertain scenarios and generate new ideas and innovative areas as possible solutions to the major challenges we face as a society, from climate change to depopulation, unequal access to technology and new forms of work.

For all these reasons, we must **focus on opportunities and avoid unintended consequences**. But the key is to do so now, with courage and determination. The greatest risks for Europe and Spain are not unintended consequences and threats. The greatest risks are falling behind in this revolution in intelligence manufacturing.

## TECHNOLOGICAL OPPORTUNITY 
We commit to thoroughly exploring and understanding {{< waiq >}} technologies, in all their scope. Our purpose is to drive excellence in research, development, and implementation of these technologies to catalyze innovation and strengthen Spain's position as a leader in the global technological landscape.

## REGULATORY SIMPLICITY
We recognize the pressing need for a regulatory framework that stimulates innovation while protecting individual and collective rights. We advocate for collaboration with legislators, experts, and civil society to create policies and regulations that foster the ethical and responsible development of {{< waiq >}} technologies, ensuring a good life and future for all in the age of the knowledge economy. We want to ensure Europe and Spain relevance and leadership in this new global landscape. To achieve this, we can create a path towards prosperity for our citizens, society and economy.

## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NECESSITY
We understand the importance of safeguarding intellectual property and promoting an environment conducive to the creation and protection of content and innovative ideas. We are dedicated to working closely with businesses, academic institutions, and government bodies to develop strategies that drive industrial property in the field of Technologies, promoting competitiveness and economic growth.

We also understand Intellectual property as a key asset for organizations, regardless of their sector, therefore the need for mechanisms that offer guarantees to innovators and developers in an agile and simple manner, within a context of legal stability and safety.

## ETHICAL AS A FUNDAMENTAL BASEMENT

We assume the responsibility of guiding technological development with a **strong ethical foundation and fundamental values**. We commit to leading discussions, provide guidance, voices and opinions on the ethical implications of {{< waiq >}} technologies and advocating for practices that respect the privacy, and of course the fundamental human rights, that ensure diversity and inclusion, and which promote an environment where everyone has a voice, everyone belongs, and everyone has the chances, means and opportunities that are needed to succeed.

We seek to be an ethical beacon that lights the way toward a more just and sustainable technological future.

## SPAIN, AS A  TERRITORY 
Europe, but also Spain, is in a good position due to its entrepreneurial ecosystem, talent, and ICT infrastructure to be one of the countries that seizes this opportunity. However, it is failing to be there, and this situation doesn’t show any signs of changing unless decisive and brave actions are taken immediately. A long-term effort to create a whole new ecosystem and paradigm is needed. That long-term effort needs concrete short-term actions such as significant investments in WAIQ technologies, attraction and retention of national and international talent, revamping and reimagining our educational system, with a special focus on universities, and a tight integration between research institutions and industrial organizations. In addition, there must be efficient and coordinated public policies and private initiatives that mobilize local and international capital, as well as new {{< waiq >}} innovation hubs that, beyond technology, analyze the opportunity from the holistic perspective proposed in this manifesto.

We make ourselves available to the Spanish Public Administrations and other relevant stakeholders to drive the creation of {{< waiq >}} ecosystems in the country and promote a culture of innovation in this field.

## WELCOME TO THE {{< waiq >}} AGE 
In conclusion, {{< waiq >}} stands as a catalyst for technological transformation, advocating excellence, responsibility and growth and prosperity for everyone. We take the responsibility of leading as a group of citizens committed to their country, but with global vision and reach, working tirelessly to promote a future where innovation benefits all of humanity. 

We do this because we believe that this is the path towards a better life for all, and a better present and future for citizens, economies and societies.

We hope that this manifesto can inspire and inform experts and enthusiasts in these fields to continue exploring and innovating and to continue building new ideas that fundamentally transform humanity, push the limits of what it is believed to be possible, tackle our biggest challenges and create prosperity for all.
