  On November 24, 2025, the Rafael del Pino Foundation held the presentation of the INTEC 2025 Report, prepared within the framework of the Rafael del Pino Chair in Science and Society. Entitled "A roadmap for innovation in complex times," the report offers an in-depth and rigorous look at the scientific, technological, and social challenges facing Spain in an international context marked by uncertainty.
  The welcome address to the event underscored a message that sums up the Foundation's philosophy: science, innovation, and technology transfer are not abstract concepts, but real levers for strengthening the country's economic, social, and institutional progress. At a time of unprecedented technological acceleration, but also of polarization, misinformation, and crisis of confidence, the Foundation asserts the need to build a common vision in which science, business, and society converge.
