description: "The patent system has historically been one of the pillars of the
  innovation ecosystem: it offers an economic incentive to those who create;
  that is, there is the expectation of an economic benefit generated in exchange
  for the temporary transfer of the use of their inventions. But if part of the
  creative process is taken over by AI, how do we redefine the value,
  authorship, and protection of what has been invented?"
