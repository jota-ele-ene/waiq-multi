  The quick evolution of Artificial Intelligence is redefining the
  economy and work, moving from automation to cognitive collaboration
  between humans and machines. Áurea Rodríguez introduces the concept of “human-AI mixed work,” where AI frees up routine tasks and amplifies creativity, critical thinking, and ethical decision-making. This gives rise to Gross Internal Talent (GIT), a metric that integrates irreplaceable human capabilities
  with the power of AI to generate large-scale solutions,
  guiding growth toward an “augmented economy.”
