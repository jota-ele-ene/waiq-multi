It is with great pride that we announce the official unveiling of Spain's **National Quantum Technology Strategy 2025-2030**, a landmark roadmap that places Spain at the forefront of European and global quantum innovation. This comprehensive document is the outcome of a collaborative effort between the Ministry for Digital Transformation and Public Function and the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities. It marks a crucial step forward in propelling quantum technologies within the country.

Quantum technologies represent a historic opportunity to enhance Spain's digital sovereignty, boost competitiveness, and ensure sustainable, ethical, and well-regulated development. The initial investment of €808 million is expected to generate a dynamic ecosystem that could mobilize up to €1.5 billion through public-private collaboration, fostering enterprise creation, advanced research, technology transfer, and specialized talent development.

This strategy is framed within Spain's advanced scientific infrastructure and growing ecosystem with clusters across various regions. To accelerate leadership, seven strategic priority lines are highlighted:

- Strengthening Spanish companies in quantum technologies and fostering a dynamic market.
- Promoting convergence between artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
- Establishing Spain as a European leader in quantum communications.
- Demonstrating the impact of quantum sensing and metrology across strategic sectors.
- Enhancing privacy and confidentiality in the post-quantum world.
- Reinforcing infrastructure, research, and talent.
- Fostering a cohesive national ecosystem that leads within the European Union.

Quantum technologies will have a significant economic impact, with the global market expected to reach $173 billion by 2040, alongside positive effects in society, healthcare, mobility, cybersecurity, and ecological transition.

The launch event took place in April 2025 in Madrid during the OECD Global Technology Forum, attended by government representatives, academics, and private sector leaders, underscoring Spain’s commitment to a quantum future.

We invite the entire technology community, academia, business sectors, and civil society to join this determined push. Spain is poised to become an international reference in quantum technologies, and the success of this strategy depends on collective efforts to innovate, collaborate, and actively participate in the quantum ecosystem.

Let us embrace this historic challenge to redefine the technological, digital, and economic future of our nation. Together, we will explore new frontiers and establish Spain as a leading quantum innovation hub in Europe and worldwide.
