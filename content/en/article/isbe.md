    The launch of ISBE allows Spain to be a pioneer in the construction of sovereign decentralised ecosystems. It is a public-private infrastructure with defined governance, segregated roles, distributed control and verifiable start-up, requirements that form the basis of an infrastructure that aspires to cross-border qualification and recognition. For this reason, ISBE is positioned to be the first qualified blockchain network in Europe; networks that have substantive legal effect, presumption of veracity and cross-border recognition.
