## What is {{< waiq >}}?
{{< waiq >}} stands for **Web3, Artificial Intelligence, and Quantum Sciences**. Beyond the acronym, {{< waiq >}} began as a summer course at Harvard Law School, to which a group of technologists, lawyers, and other experts in the field of information and communication technologies (ICT) were invited to participate. However, {{< waiq >}} is now much more than that, as it has become a think tank that discusses emerging technologies, the opportunities they present for innovation and their impact on society. Discover what inspires us, the reason behind {{< waiq >}} and why we do what we do [by reading our manifesto](/legal/manifesto).


## Who are we? 
We are a community of independent professionals with our own goals, interests and dynamics. We all work for different companies and institutions, but {{< waiq >}} is completely independent from all of them and they do not interfere in its decisions, content, activities or representation. All opinions, analyses or activities of the community are those of the WAIQers themselves.[Learn about them here](/waiqers’).


## Why do we do it? 
We firmly believe that it is people who drive technology, not the other way around. Furthermore, technological evolution raises many concerns and challenges due to its impact on human life. Intelligent people who talk and exchange knowledge can solve complex problems and improve society. Our goal is to address the challenges posed by the adoption of technology, taking into account the legal, regulatory and ethical dimensions. 

## What's on this website? 
We want it to be a meeting point where we can share thoughts, ideas, articles, projects and common interests, as well as a showcase that gives visibility to all #WAIQers. You will find references published in external sources, reports and some reflections and analyses by #WAIQers on topics related to {{< waiq >}}.


## Who is it aimed at? 
Are you interested in {{< waiq >}}technologies? Do you want to learn about them? There are many sources on the Internet to do so. Don't come here to learn about web3 technologies, the latest AI model or simply news about the race for quantum supremacy. You will find this website useful if you want to promote critical thinking about emerging technologies, their development and adoption.


## How can I contribute?
Of course, the website is open to adding new content, from use cases that implement {{< waiq >}} technologies to your opinions about them, regulation and how they affect our lives. We encourage you to send us any content, articles, projects, or initiatives you would like to share with #WAIQers to our email address hello@waiq.technology. Anything you think might inspire, serve as a reference, or add value to other members is welcome.
